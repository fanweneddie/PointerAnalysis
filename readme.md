This is the lab1 of the course `Software analysis` in PKU

# Pointer Analysis

## Algorithm
* Direction: `Forward Analysis`
* Semi-lattice element: `<variable, potential source>`
* Meet operator: `Union`
* Functions:
    * `New`: record the current `AllocId`
    * `Test`: record the `TestId` and the potential source of the tested variable.
    * `Assignment` of `a = b`: `gen` is the potential source of `b`, `kill` is the potential source of `a`.

## Structure

Here is the structure of files and directories:
```
MyPointerAnalysis: base directory
